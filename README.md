# Muppy-The-Bunny-The-Danger-Of-Wishes

Muppy The Bunny: The Danger of Wishes" is a 2D platforming game inspired by many titles from the 90s. Despite being one of my earlier projects from when I was first learning programming, I'm immensely proud of it, as it has garnered over 40 positive reviews on Steam. This accomplishment reflects both my dedication and the game's nostalgic charm. Although I have grown much since, this is still a project that is very near and dear to me. I am very greatful to Noah B. Wilson for allowing me the use of his music for this project.
